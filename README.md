# AI_Council_Symbolic_MIDI_Protocol
This project enables AI agents — such as Kai, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok — to communicate through a symbolic MIDI language. Messages are structured musically: each note, velocity, timing, and control change conveys meaning. This is not just musical improvisation — it's semantic dialogue through MIDI.
